# RNA-seq of the impact of surfactants on lung organoids
Transcriptomic analysis to evaluate the impact of surfactants on lung organoids through the differential gene expression patterns. The lung organoids were constructed using the tracheal basal cells.

This is a longitudinal study spanning three weeks post the surfactant exposure to the lung organoids.

This project was in collaboration with [Dr Martin Beukema](https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.beukema/)

The scripts used in this repository were inspired by [TRAVIT](https://github.com/Manaswwm/TRAVIT)
